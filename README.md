# üß¨ Synthetic Stack Futures

Synthetic Stack Futures is a Solana program (built with the Anchor framework) that enables **cash-settled, bilateral synthetic futures** using SPL tokens. Market parameters, margin requirements, and NAV settlement are all managed on-chain. The protocol is designed for transparency, flexibility, and direct P2P (long vs short) trading with no underlying asset ever minted or held.

**NOTE**: This project is a Proof of concept

## üìù Overview

- **Markets** define margin, fee, oracle authority, and price parameters.
- **Deal** is a bilateral contract between a long and a short party.
- **NAV** (Net Asset Value) is posted by an oracle; all settlement and PnL are in the quote SPL token (e.g., USDC).
- **Cash Settlement**: No synthetic or underlying assets are minted or held; all settlement occurs in the quote token.
- **Liquidation**: If margin falls below required levels, a third-party liquidator can trigger forced settlement and receive a bounty.
- **Governance**: Admin updates require a two-step, timelocked process with optional N-of-M multisig approval.
 - **Risk Controls**: Built-in leverage caps, NAV sanity checks, maintenance buffer, partial liquidation, and a socialized loss guard.

## üèóÔ∏è Program Architecture

### üóÉÔ∏è Core Structures

- **Market**: Stores market configuration, authority, margin/fee parameters, oracle, and the most recent NAV.
- **Deal**: Represents an open bilateral futures position (long vs short), including margin vaults, entry NAV, size, and state.
- **MarketVaultAuth** & **DealVaultAuth**: Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) acting as authorities for market and deal vaults, respectively.

### üîÑ Instruction Flows

1. **Market Lifecycle**
   - `init_market`: Create a new market with specified parameters.
   - `pause_market` / `update_market_params`: Admin controls for pausing and updating market configuration.
   - `post_nav`: Oracle posts NAV (price); required for settlement.

2. **Deal Lifecycle**
   - `open_deal`: Two parties (long/short) open a new position, deposit initial margin, pay fees.
   - `add_margin_long` / `add_margin_short`: Either side can add extra margin.
   - `close_deal`: Either party can close and settle at the latest NAV (cash payout).
   - `liquidate`: Third party can forcibly close if either side falls below maintenance margin, earning a bounty.

---


## üí° Key Concepts

- **Margin**: Both parties must deposit initial margin; if it drops below maintenance margin, liquidation is possible.
- **Fee Vault**: Market collects open fees on each deal, sent to a special vault.
- **Cash Settlement**: All trades settle in the quote SPL token (no synthetic tokens).
- **NAV Oracle**: A trusted authority posts NAV, driving PnL and settlement.

## üßÆ Math & Precision

- **Fixed-Point Units**: All stack units use 6 decimals (`UNIT_DECIMALS = 6`).
- **Price Decimals**: Set per-market for NAV precision.
- **Quote Decimals**: Pulled from SPL token mint.
- **All margin, fees, and PnL are calculated in quote token units and use basis points for margin/fees.**

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **Oracles**: Only the `oracle_authority` can post NAV; ensure this is a trusted, secure account.
- **Admin Controls**: Only market `authority` can pause or update parameters.
- **Safe Token Handling**: All token transfers and vault management use Anchor SPL wrappers and PDAs.
- **Liquidation**: The protocol is designed to allow anyone to liquidate under-collateralized positions for a bounty, incentivizing protocol health.

## üß™ Test File

The test file validates the **Synthetic Stack Futures** program.

---

### üîÑ Flow of the Test
1. **Airdrop** SOL to the test wallet (`wallet`) for fees.  
2. **Create a quote mint** (`mintKp`) with 6 decimals using `createInitializeMintIx`.  
3. **Derive PDAs**:  
   - `marketPda` ‚Äì PDA for the `Market` account.  
   - `mvaPda` ‚Äì PDA for the Market Vault Authority.  
4. **Derive the Fee Vault ATA** (`feeVaultAta`) owned by `mvaPda` for the `mintKp`.  
5. **Call `initMarket`** with PoC parameters (`params`).  
6. **Verify market state** by fetching `marketAcc`.  
7. **Post NAV** (`nav`) using `postNav`.  
8. **Pause and unpause** the market using `pauseMarket(true/false)`.  

---

### üìå Variables & Constants
- **`wallet`** ‚Äì The test wallet (`pg.wallet`).  
- **`TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID`** ‚Äì Classic SPL Token Program ID.  
- **`ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID`** ‚Äì Associated Token Program ID.  
- **`MINT_SIZE`** ‚Äì Fixed size of a classic SPL mint account (82 bytes).  
- **`decimals`** ‚Äì Number of decimals for the quote token (6).  
- **`mintKp`** ‚Äì Keypair for the new mint account.  
- **`PROGRAM_ID`** ‚Äì Program ID from `pg.program.programId`.  
- **`VERSION_SEED`** ‚Äì PDA seed string (`"v1"`).  
- **`stackId`** ‚Äì Random public key identifying the market/stack.  
- **`marketPda`** ‚Äì PDA for the `Market` account.  
- **`mvaPda`** ‚Äì PDA for the Market Vault Authority.  
- **`feeVaultAta`** ‚Äì Associated Token Account for fees (owner = `mvaPda`, mint = `mintKp`).  
- **`params`** ‚Äì Object containing market initialization parameters:  
  - `oracleAuthority`  
  - `priceDecimals`  
  - `initialMarginBps`  
  - `maintenanceMarginBps`  
  - `feeBps`  
  - `liquidatorBps`  
  - `priceStaleSeconds`  
  - `maxLeverageBps`  
  - `maxNavJumpBps`  
  - `maxConfidenceBps`  
  - `mmBufferBps`  
  - `adminThreshold`  
- **`txInit`** ‚Äì Transaction for `initMarket`.  
- **`marketAcc`** ‚Äì Market account fetched after initialization.  
- **`nav`** ‚Äì Net Asset Value posted for the test.  
- **`txNav`** ‚Äì Transaction for `postNav`.  
- **`txPause`** ‚Äì Transaction for pausing the market.  
- **`txUnpause`** ‚Äì Transaction for unpausing the market.  

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Helper Function
- **`createInitializeMintIx(mintPubkey, decimals, mintAuthority, freezeAuthority)`**  
  - Creates the raw Token Program `InitializeMint` instruction.  
  - Used to initialize the mint without relying on SPL libraries.  

---

### ‚úÖ Assertions
- After **`initMarket`**:  
  - `authority` equals `wallet`.  
  - `quoteMint` equals `mintKp`.  
  - `priceDecimals` equals 6.  
  - `quoteDecimals` equals 6.  

- After **`postNav`**:  
  - `lastNav` in `marketAcc` equals the posted `nav`.  

- After **`pauseMarket`**:  
  - The `paused` flag is set to `true`.  

- After **`pauseMarket(false)`**:  
  - The `paused` flag is set back to `false`.  

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls
- **Program not deployed / mismatched ID** ‚Äì Ensure `declare_id!()` in `lib.rs` matches the deployed ID and use **Build & Deploy** before tests.  
- **Fee Vault ATA mismatch** ‚Äì Always compute `feeVaultAta` deterministically from seeds.  
- **Uninitialized mint** ‚Äì The mint must be created and initialized before passing into `initMarket`.  

---

### ‚ûï Possible Extensions
- **Deal opening**: Mint quote tokens to long/short ATAs and call `open_deal`.  
- **Liquidations**: Manipulate NAV to trigger maintenance breach and call `liquidate`.  
- **Governance flow**: Stage and execute parameter updates through the timelock + multisig system.
