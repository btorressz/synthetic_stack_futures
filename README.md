# ðŸ§¬ Synthetic Stack Futures

Synthetic Stack Futures is a Solana program (built with the Anchor framework) that enables **cash-settled, bilateral synthetic futures** using SPL tokens. Market parameters, margin requirements, and NAV settlement are all managed on-chain. The protocol is designed for transparency, flexibility, and direct P2P (long vs short) trading with no underlying asset ever minted or held.

**NOTE**: This project is a Proof of concept
